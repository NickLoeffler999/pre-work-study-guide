# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to do this project because it's something I'm very interested in learning more about, and wanted somewhere to hold my notes. I wanted to have a website that I can share with my family and friends to show them the progress of what I'm doing as well. This project, to me, is a large step in moving my career forward and transitioning into a Web Developer, and gives me a lot of motivation going ahead in the bootcamp. I built this project as a place to store my notes, using code. I'm going to update it with notes on HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, and many other topics as I move on through the course. I learned a lot through the Prework on topics including HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript that I had no idea even existed prior. I've also learned much about having a growth mindset, which has helped me out extensively while completing this project.
